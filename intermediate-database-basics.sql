-- ///////// ECOMM SIMULATION  ///////////

-- SUMMARY:
-- Let's simulate an e-commerce site. We're going to need users, products, and orders.

-- users need a name and an email.
-- products need a name and a price
-- orders need a ref to product.
-- All 3 need primary keys.


-- INSTRUCTIONS:
-- Create 3 tables following the criteria in the summary.
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  	person_id INTEGER,
    person_name VARCHAR(200),
    email VARCHAR(200)
);
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    item_id INTEGER,
    product_name VARCHAR(200),
    product_price NUMERIC

    product_name VARCHAR(200),

    product_price NUMERIC,
    order_date TIMESTAMP,
    quantity INTEGER,
